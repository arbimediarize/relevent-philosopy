I'm not making any promises based off of what I write in this repositoy. The only thing that I'm asking you is to trust is yourself. Read these arguments, decide if you believe them or not, and proceed with your life.

This repositoy is NOT a replacement for a solid moral education. Presumably you have lived an entire life making decisions before reading this. You can encorporate these thoughts into your decision-making process or not. It's up to you. I think of them mostly as reminders. It might also help to inform your thinking about how to use the work contained in this organization.

As of this writing, I (dd-olive) have only a philosophy and no code. I hope that the philosphy on its own is useful, but my intention is to also write code that will make it easier for people to trust each other.

I know that my code is not going to be perfect, the people helping me write code are not going to be perfect, and that there are better technical solutions out there. I'll try to keep track of alternatives so that it's easier to follow through on this philosophy, but I'm hoping to verify things from the ground-up so that I'm contributing more than just a guiding philosphy.

A lot of what I do is very confusing, but I really am trying to help.

The reposity "relevent-philosophy" *should* be open to the public. Feel free to copy, share, add, substract, take inspiration, criticize, redicule, advise privately.... do whatever you want with this information. The sharing the philosophy of my work is something that consider a religious obligation, because I think it applies to more than just *my* work. I think the world would be a better place if people would do their best and work together. I understand that not everybody thinks the same way. The only thing that I ask is that you try to verify who said what, when before you get too angry at failures and broken promises.
