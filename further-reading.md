A key aspect of the "relevent-philosophy" repository is that it only contains philosphy that is relevent to the arbimediarize organization. Sometimes, life circumstances inspire us to think deeply about topics that might not inform a pressing decision. This document is meant to provide guidance on resources that will help you think about ethics in general.

Find a moral leader
===

Ethics is complicated business, and this repository is NOT going to make you an expert. It provides just enough information to guide a technical project, NOT your entire life, and NOT an entire society. If you need help, find help. You might try asking as pastor, a lawyer, a teacher, a boss, a spouse, a friend, or a relative. 

Take time to think
===

Any decisions that you make are yours to live with, and yours alone. Thinking through a decision takes time, and that's okay.

Internet Resources
===

If you are interested in providing help to people thinking through religious decisions, ethical dillemas, or life philosophies, post somewhere online and open an issue with a link to your post. The post must be public, you shouldn't need to sign into anything in order to see information that will help establish trust.
There are internet safety rules that everyone (including myself) should use before clicking on a link. I'll be using my own best judgement while making decisions on what links to click on and what links to share in this document. 
If you are reading this document online, then you already made the decision to be online, and I'm going to presume that you will appriciate the convenience of online links.

Books
===

If you want to do your reading entirely offline, that is an option too. Ask a moral leader guidance on which books to read. I'm currently asking for help recommending books to any readers that might not have a moral leader that they can trust. If you have recommendations, please open an issue and I'll check it out.
