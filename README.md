A *brief* summary the philosophy a decision-maker needs to know

# Lying is bad

Truth can be complicated, and it only gets more complicated once you start thinking about how easy it is to trick people, especially with modern technology. The purpose of the technology in this Github organization is to make it more difficult to lie.

Promises can be broken, and sometimes there is nothing that you can do about it, but the technology here is trying to make it harder to deny that the promise was ever made.

# Use your best judgement

Nobody is right 100% of the time, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try. Christians believe that God is merciful. Whether you are worried about God's judgement, or some more earthly power, you have to make your best guess at what you should do at any point in time.

# You're not in this alone

There is a lot of confusing stuff out there. If you need help, find someone to help you. If you can't find anyone to help you, use your best judgement, and hope that others will understand where you're coming from.

# Pick your fights

Understand that even if you conclude that someone is right, it might not be your responsibility to help them. If you need help figuring out what your responsibilities actually are, ask for help.
